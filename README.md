# Generative AI Workshop Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during the 2-day Generative AI workshop at BGSCET. The workshop covered fundamental concepts in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provided hands-on experience with various applications.

## Projects

1. **House Price Prediction:**
   - **Description:** A regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) is used to predict house prices based on various features (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms).
   - **Technologies:** Python, [Relevant Libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy]
   - **Files:**
     -` (Jupyter Notebook containing the code)
     - `data/house_price_data.csv` (Dataset used for training and testing)
     - `README.md` (This file)

2. **Insurance Analysis:**
   - **Description:**  [Describe the type of insurance analysis performed.  For example:] This project analyzes insurance claim data to identify trends, patterns, and potential risk factors. 
   - **Technologies:** Python, [Relevant Libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn (for visualization)]
   - **Files:**
     -  (Jupyter Notebook or Python script)
     - `data/insurance_data.csv` (Dataset)
     - `README.md`

3. **Travel Package Analysis:**
   - **Description:** [Describe the analysis. For example:] This project analyzes travel data to recommend personalized travel packages based on user preferences and travel history.
   - **Technologies:** Python, [Relevant Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, surprise (for recommendation systems, if used)]
   - **Files:**
     -  (Jupyter Notebook or Python script)
     - `travel_data.csv` (Dataset)
   

4. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - **Description:** This project performs sentiment analysis on text data (e.g., customer reviews, social media posts) to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
   - **Technologies:** Python, [Relevant Libraries like NLTK, VADER, TextBlob]
   - **Files:**
     -  (Jupyter Notebook or Python script)
